# PostSaving

Save postcard images from Postcrossing.

Everyone have their favorite postcards on the website, and it is possible to download the images when one digs into the source code. Most people don't want to do that however. This extension adds a "Save image" link to the postcard pages, so you can easily keep your favorite cards for your memory.

I'm not affiliated with Postcrossing in any way, though I do love to use them. Send postcards and support them! Cheers!

This app uses the minimum that needs to be done for this to work, modifying a tiny portion of a single website. To download it, find the [app in the Chrome Web Store][cws].
